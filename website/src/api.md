# Catalog

`Catalog` is the entry point for accessing iceberg tables. You can use a catalog to:

* Create and list namespaces.
* Create, load, and drop tables

Currently only rest catalog has been implemented, and other catalogs are under active development. Here is an 
example of how to create a `RestCatalog`:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../crates/examples/src/rest_catalog_namespace.rs:create_catalog}}
```

You can run following code to list all root namespaces:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../crates/examples/src/rest_catalog_namespace.rs:list_all_namespace}}
```

Then you can run following code to create namespace:
```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../crates/examples/src/rest_catalog_namespace.rs:create_namespace}}
```

# Table

After creating `Catalog`, we can manipulate tables through `Catalog`.

You can use following code to create a table:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../crates/examples/src/rest_catalog_table.rs:create_table}}
```

Also, you can load a table directly:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../crates/examples/src/rest_catalog_table.rs:load_table}}
```

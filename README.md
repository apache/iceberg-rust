## Supported Rust Version

Iceberg Rust is built and tested with stable rust, and will keep a rolling MSRV(minimum supported rust version). The 
current MSRV is 1.77.1. 

Also, iceberg-rust use unstable rust to run linters, such as `clippy` and `rustfmt`. But this will not affect downstream users, 
and only MSRV is required.

//! Partitioning writers for handling partitioned Iceberg tables.
//!
//! This module provides two strategies for writing to partitioned tables:
//! - [`FanoutWriter`](fanout_writer::FanoutWriter): Handles unsorted data by maintaining multiple active writers
//! - [`ClusteredWriter`](clustered_writer::ClusteredWriter): Optimized for pre-sorted data with single active writer

pub mod clustered_writer;
pub mod fanout_writer;

use crate::Result;
use crate::spec::PartitionKey;
use crate::writer::{DefaultInput, DefaultOutput};

/// A writer that can write data to partitioned tables.
///
/// This trait provides methods for writing data with partition keys and
/// closing the writer to retrieve the output.

    ///    another concurrently processing data file scan task. If it is, we skip it.

    ///    the EQ delete's record batch stream, convert it to a predicate, update the delete filter,

    ///    The result of this is a map of data file paths to delete vectors for the positional
    ///    delete tasks (and in future for the delete vector tasks). For equality delete
    ///    file tasks, this results in an unbound Predicate.
    ///  * The unbound Predicates resulting from equality deletes are sent to their associated oneshot
    ///    channel to store them in the right place in the delete file managers state.
    ///  * The results of all of these futures are awaited on in parallel with the specified
    ///    level of concurrency and collected into a vec. We then combine all the delete

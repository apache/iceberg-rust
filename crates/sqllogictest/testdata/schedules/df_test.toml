# Step 3: Insert data and verify (covers both unpartitioned and partitioned tables)

# Step 4: Test DROP TABLE

# Note: CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE tests are in:
# crates/integrations/datafusion/src/table/table_provider_factory.rs
# They require absolute paths which sqllogictest doesn't support variable substitution for.

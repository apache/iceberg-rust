# Plan / Todo

The current plan for in-flight work. The operating manuals ([skills/](../skills/)) require this file
to be written **before** any non-trivial change and kept current as work proceeds.

How to use it (see the manuals' §1):

- Write a 3–7 bullet plan here before writing code.
- Flip `[ ]` → `[x]` as items complete; add a one-sentence "what changed and why" per step.
- Add indented sub-bullets when a step reveals unexpected complexity.
- Leave an `Outcome:` / `Done:` note when the work lands.

## Active: Phase 1 — Spec & metadata completeness

Parity target: Java `iceberg-core` evolution APIs. Authoritative plan: [Roadmap.md](../Roadmap.md)
Phase 1; status checklist: [docs/parity/GAP_MATRIX.md](../docs/parity/GAP_MATRIX.md).

**Scaffolding (verified on 0.9.1):** actions follow the `transaction/sort_order.rs` pattern — a builder
struct + `#[async_trait] impl TransactionAction { async fn commit(self: Arc<Self>, &Table) ->
Result<ActionCommit> }` returning `ActionCommit::new(updates, requirements)`, plus a `pub fn` ctor on
`Transaction` and a `mod`/`use` line in `transaction/mod.rs`. `TableMetadataBuilder` already has the
low-level primitives; `TableUpdate` already has `SetSnapshotRef`/`RemoveSnapshotRef`/`AddSchema`/
`SetCurrentSchema`/`AddSpec`/`SetDefaultSpec`; `TableRequirement::RefSnapshotIdMatch{ref, snapshot_id:
Option<i64>}` (None ⇒ ref must not exist) guards concurrency. Java ref at `/tmp/iceberg-java-ref`.

### Sequencing (dependency, then value)
1. **ManageSnapshots** (this increment) — self-contained ref manipulation; primitives all exist.
2. **UpdatePartitionSpec** — addField/removeField/renameField → new spec via `AddSpec`/`SetDefaultSpec`.
3. **UpdateSchema** (largest) — add/drop/rename/update-type/move/make-req-opt + field-id reassignment
   and type-promotion validation → `AddSchema`/`SetCurrentSchema`. Split into sub-steps.
4. ManageSnapshots tail — `cherrypick` (needs snapshot replay) + `rollbackToTime`.
5. V3 groundwork — row-lineage fields, finish column-default plumbing.

Each item: behavioral parity with Java + unit tests (same change) + GAP_MATRIX row flip.

### Increment 1 — ManageSnapshots ✅ DONE
New file `crates/iceberg/src/transaction/manage_snapshots.rs`; wired into `transaction/mod.rs`.

- [x] create/replace/remove branch+tag (kind-checked); `rename_branch`.
- [x] `set_current_snapshot`; `rollback_to` (ancestry-validated); `fast_forward` (ancestry-validated).
- [x] retention: `set_min_snapshots_to_keep` / `set_max_snapshot_age_ms` / `set_max_ref_age_ms`
      (branch-only fields rejected on tags).
- [x] commit(): ops resolved in order against a working ref map seeded from `metadata().refs`; emits
      `SetSnapshotRef`/`RemoveSnapshotRef` + per-ref `RefSnapshotIdMatch` guard (original id, None if
      absent); snapshot ids validated via `snapshot_by_id`.
- [x] 12 unit tests via `make_v2_table()`; build + clippy(-D warnings) + fmt + offline lib suite green
      (1170 tests, stable across 6 runs).
- [x] Flipped `ManageSnapshots` + snapshot-refs GAP_MATRIX rows to 🟡.
  - Side fix: relaxed a flaky upstream assertion in `catalog/memory/catalog.rs` test_update_table
    (`last_updated_ms() <` → `<=`), exposed by the extra parallel test load. See task/lessons.md.

**Outcome:** branch/tag lifecycle + rollback + fast-forward + retention land with optimistic-concurrency
guards. **Deferred to increment 4:** `cherrypick` (needs snapshot replay), `rollbackToTime`,
`replaceBranch(from,to)`; a Java interop round-trip before the row flips to ✅.

#### Review remediation (2026-06-07, post multi-agent review) — DONE
- [x] `fast_forward` Java-parity fixes: `to` may be a tag; absent `from` auto-created; no-op when
      already at target. Verified against `UpdateSnapshotReferencesOperation.replaceBranch`.
- [x] commit() emit-time no-op suppression (create-then-remove, ff-to-same, replace-to-same emit nothing).
- [x] +14 tests (now 26): rollback non-ancestor, ff wrong-direction, remove/rename main guards, rename
      collision, remove/replace of pre-existing refs (guard carries original id), forked fixture.
- [x] Created `docs/testing.md` (was referenced 14× but missing); reconciled headline-gaps + Roadmap
      Phase 1 status (🟡) with the matrix; removed stale `iceberg-spark-python` line from `skills/*.md`.
- [ ] **Follow-up (unverified):** retention positivity validation (Java may reject `≤ 0` for
      min_snapshots_to_keep / max_snapshot_age_ms / max_ref_age_ms). A grep of `SnapshotRef.java` found
      no such `checkArgument` — confirm where (if anywhere) Java enforces it before adding it here.

### Next up — Increment 2: UpdatePartitionSpec
addField/removeField/renameField → new spec via `TableUpdate::AddSpec`/`SetDefaultSpec`
(`TableMetadataBuilder::add_partition_spec`/`set_default_partition_spec` already exist).
